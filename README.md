#### Step 1: measuring
 
steps to create marking (to be cut) for net-pots:
Mark one side of the PVC Vinyl pipe (4 x 4 X 72 inches) every 10 inches. You will end up with 6 marks with 12 inches left from the last mark to the end of the pipe. In Figures 3 and 4, each mark has been made in red with a black line connecting them. Only the black part of each line should be cut and the red mark should stay since the 2 inch net-pots have 0.2 inch lips. 
On another side (I chose a side 90 degrees to the first based on my light source) create a second row of markings. In order for the holes not to be at the same level as the first side, mark the first marking 15 inches from the top (instead of 10 inches on the first side) and go 10 inches for each of the next markings as usual so the markings will be at 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 inches. You will end up with 5 markings with 17 inches to be spared from the last marking to the end of the pvc pipe. See Figure 8.
Note: For this size pipe, all four sides should not be used as the roots will be too large for the hydroponics to handle

***Figure 3*** 

#### Step 2: cutting

use a cutting tool to cut only the part that was marked using a black marker. Do not cut the part of the line that was marked using a red marker. Otherwise the hole will be too large for 2 inches net-pots.  


![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/Drill_netcup.png?raw=true)
***Figure 4*** 


After cutting, we need to shape the holes. For this part we need a tool that is close to the size of the net-pot top.  I used an empty spray can that was a perfect fit.

![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/bottle_netcup_top.png?raw=true)
***Figure 5*** 


#### Step 3: heating

In order to prepare the cut area for shaping, we need to heat the area with a swiping motion.
Since I did not have a heat gun, I used a propane torch. It would be harder to use a propane torch since you need to constantly monitor the area to make sure the PVC pipe heats up evenly without burning the pipe. If the pipe does get a little burned and turns yellow or even brown, you can later cover it up with white PVC vinyl cement. This cement can also help fill up the hole from each side if you have cut the hole larger than intended. 


![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/blowtorch.png?raw=true)
***Figure 6*** 


#### Step 4: creating holes

While the cut area is still hot, insert the can. Once you are happy with the shape, leave the can for a few minutes for the hole to keep the shape. If you do not want to wait for the area to cool down naturally, you can use a wet towel to cool down the area.


![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/blowtorch_can.png?raw=true)
***Figure 7***

I made two identical posts. Each post will have 11 holes (6 on one side and 5 on the other side)

***Figure 8*** 


#### Step 5: preparing the water-pump

In order to be able to use one water pump for both towers (pvc posts), I used a T joiner to be able to split the stream as seen in figure 9.



![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/waterpump_connections.png?raw=true)
***Figure 9***



#### Step 6: drilling hole for T joiner

I used a Â½ inch drill bit (larger or smaller based on your T hose joiner diameter) to drill a hole as seen in figure 10.



![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/half_inch_drill.png?raw=true)
***Figure 10***




#### Step 7: drilling holes for rain shower

Drill small holes to create the rain shower effect. Start with only a few holes and drill more if needed. These holes can be different sizes as long as they are evenly distributed. I made 4 larger holes around the center to direct more flow towards the middle to prevent splashing out of the net-pots. See Figure 11.



![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/rain_shower_wholes.png?raw=true)
***Figure 11***

#### Step 8: installing T joiner 

Insert T joiner to the hole that was drilled in step 6. It should fit tight.

***Figure 12***




#### Step 9: installing tube

Insert the vinyl tube to the T joiner.

***Figure 13***




#### Step 10: install rain-shower part 

Pass the vinyl tubing attached to the rain shower cap through the tower




![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/top_to_tower.png?raw=true)
***Figure 14***




#### Step 11: preparing water reservoir

Hang the towers from above. I used a container with a lid as the water reservoir. I painted the container with an initial coat of brown (any dark color would work) to prevent light from entering the reservoir and then a second coat with white to prevent overheating when used outdoors. You need to make 2 holes in the lid for the PVC pipes to pass through to the reservoir (see Figure 17). Place the water reservoir under the towers and place the water pump.  
.



![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/ready_to_attach_connectors.png?raw=true)
***Figure 15***




#### Step 12: connecting water pump to tower tubes

Connect the T joiner attached to the water pump to the vinyl tubing that was passed through the towers.




![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/connection_to_water_pump.png?raw=true)
***Figure 16***





#### Step 13

![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/two_cuts_container_top.png?raw=true)
***Figure 17***



You should have something like this: you should not be able to see the vinyl tubing.

### Monitoring 
I divided the monitoring of the hydroponics into two parts

* Monitoring the solution (what is in the reservoir) 

* Monitoring the environment around the hydroponics 


Monitoring the solution:
>I used two probes:
  >> 1- pH meter - to determine and alter the pH based on the plant you are growing

  >> 2- EC/TDS (Electrical Conductivity/Total Dissolved Solids) meter- to determine and alter how much food you have in your solution 

![hydroponics main image](https://github.com/hrmanpi/hydroponics/blob/hrmanpi-hydroponics2/images/ph_ec.png?raw=true)
***Figure 19***

Monitoring the environment around the hydroponics 
I kept track of 3 values remotely using a RPi and a simple free iot application called cayenne. The sensors used to collect those 3 values are:
* DHT11 - Digital Temperature Humidity Sensor - to keep track of  the temperature  and humidity in the environment 
* DS18B20 - Water Thermometer - placed in the reservoir solution to keep track of the temperature of the solution
  

#### Step 14

Raspberry pi + breadboard + sensors
Using double sided tape, the DHT11 sensor was mounted to a wall close to the hydroponic towers.
Since the DS18B20 sensor needs to be in the reservoir water, I added extra wire to the sensor to extend the reach of the sensor

#### Deep learning:

In addition, raspberry pi camera and deep learning (keras/tensorflow) will be used to monitor the plants and its root health. 

Analyzing plant diseases, nutrient deficiencies and root health by analyzing the images taken by raspberry pi using deep learning.

Sample nutrient deficiency images
