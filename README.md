# Vertical Hydroponics Tower Project
###### Phase 1 - construction using Raspberry pi, IoT (Cayenne), Temperature, Humidity, Sensors
###### Phase 2 - automation using PH, EC probe, PRi camera, relay and deep learning.

#### PHASE 1

#### Step 1: measuring
 
steps to create marking (to be cut) for net-pots:
Mark one side of the PVC Vinyl pipe (4 x 4 X 72 inches) every 10 inches. You will end up with 6 marks with 12 inches left from the last mark to the end of the pipe. In Figures 3 and 4, each mark has been made in red with a black line connecting them. Only the black part of each line should be cut and the red mark should stay since the 2 inch net-pots have 0.2 inch lips. 
On another side (I chose a side 90 degrees to the first based on my light source) create a second row of markings. In order for the holes not to be at the same level as the first side, mark the first marking 15 inches from the top (instead of 10 inches on the first side) and go 10 inches for each of the next markings as usual so the markings will be at 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 inches. You will end up with 5 markings with 17 inches to be spared from the last marking to the end of the pvc pipe. See Figure 8.
Note: For this size pipe, all four sides should not be used as the roots will be too large for the hydroponics to handle
